<strong>Surface Urban Heat Islands</strong> (SUHI) refer to the temperature differences between urban and surrounding rural areas, 
measured using satellite-derived <strong>Land Surface Temperature</strong> (LST). SUHI is a key indicator of how urbanization affects local climate, 
with important implications for public health, energy use, and urban sustainability. <br><br>
In this work, we analysed the presence, intensity, and changes in SUHI over time in the municipality of Bologna, Italy. 
We used <strong>30-meter resolution Landsat 8 LST data</strong> processed through Google Earth Engine, focusing on summer images (June-August) from 2013 to 2024. 
To study both spatial and temporal variations in SUHI, we employed a <strong>Bayesian spatially varying coefficient (SVC) model</strong> which included a spatially 
varying intercept, interpreted as a residual spatial variation in LST, and a spatially varying linear effect of time, representing the long-term 
temporal trend in LST. These spatially structured effects were modelled using Gaussian random fields and estimated using the <strong>Stochastic Partial 
Differential Equation (SPDE)</strong> approach and the <strong>Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)</strong> framework. The model also included land cover 
types as non-spatial predictors, using a detailed land cover classification that separates urban green areas from non-urban vegetation to understand how 
different kind of vegetation affect LST.<br><br>

Posterior estimates showed that artificial surfaces and non-consolidated areas are warmer than vegetated zones while tree-covered areas are cooler compared 
to other vegetation types. Urban green spaces showed higher temperatures than their non-urban counterparts, suggesting that vegetation&apos;s cooling effect 
depends on its surroundings. The SVC model also revealed significant spatial variation in SUHI intensity, with residual spatial LST ranging from about -9 &deg;C up 
to 14 &deg;C across the area. Temporal trends also varied locally, showing areas warming up to 0.65 &deg;C per year and others experiencing cooling up to -0.75 &deg;C 
per year. <br><br>

By combining high-resolution satellite data with advanced spatial modelling through the SPDE-INLA SVC approach, we were able to 
capture both the spatial patterns and local changes of the SUHI effect over time. These findings closely matched land cover changes 
identified from satellite imagery and ISPRA land cover maps, showing how this integrated method improves our understanding of urban 
heat dynamics and supports more effective climate adaptation planning.
